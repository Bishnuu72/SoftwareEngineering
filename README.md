AGILE BASED WBS
The Agile-based WBS (Work breakdown structure) for the Inventory Management System project is a sequential plan of a development process that is split into smaller parts according to Agile principles into more doable part. First is product backlog management, in which user roles and system features, including login, product management, purchase, sales, reporting, and payment are documented and written as user stories. These features are ranked and have criteria of acceptability. The project is broken into several sprints each with a functional mandate. Sprint 1 deals with login & product, Sprint 2 has purchase & sale, and Sprint 3 is about payment integration & report generation. Following each sprint, there is feedback, and changes are made. At the same time, artifacts of system design such as use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and class diagrams are developed to assist in analysis and documentation. Testing, unit/integration/test and test are conducted during the process to ensure that all modules function appropriately. Finally, the system is cleaned up, deployed, documented, and ready for maintenance. This organized Agile WBS makes the development process smoother and with continual improvement and a working system in every phase.
